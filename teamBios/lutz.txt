A little about me: Since I joined the club, I have had the opportunity to work on both human prosthetics and pet prosthetics! I currently coordinate all of the teams working with pet prosthetics, and look forward to seeing the club grow. I am a person who is interested in almost everything, and I have had the opportunity to utilize engineering in biomedical applications, oil and gas, and aerospace at Purdue!
